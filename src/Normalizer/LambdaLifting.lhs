We implement a limited lambda-lifting pass for XMPEG.  The goal is to lift recursive definitions to
the top-level, as MIL only supports recursive definition in the global scope.  However, we do not
try to lift other definitions (or, indeed, lambda-expressions) to the top level.

Let's reconsider the initial scenario for lambda-lifting.

    let f x = g x + y
        g x = f x + z
    in M

We intend to produce new top-level definitions

    f' y z x = g y z x + y
    g' y z x = f y z x + z

What about the source expression?  As I read the Gofer report, we might expect it to be

    M[f' y z/f, g' y z/g]

But that's not safe for call-by-value---and it requires doing substitution.  What if instead we did
the following?

    let f = f' y z
        g = g' y z in M

Now this is safe for call-by-value, and I think it avoids any need to do source-level substitutions.
Of course, a final problem is that we need to compute new types for the new bindings, so we track
the types of local bindings as we go.

In the following, I'm assuming that we have no remaining nests of the sort (let x = y; y = x in E)

> inlineVariableBindings ds f = local (\envs -> envs{ binds = s ++ binds envs }) (f ds')

>           split d (s, ds) = (s, d : ds)
>           (s, ds') = foldr split ([], []) ds

With the work out of the way, we can implement a straight-forward pass over the syntax tree.

Perhaps we should store the types of pattern-bound variables in constructor patterns?

>               do ts <- asks (fromMaybe (error ("Unknown constructor: " ++ show (ppr (Inst id ts [])))) . lookup (id, ts) . ctors)
